Eventually, I will get [my website](https://www.jrcharney.com/) up and running again. WordPress kinda sucks and it doesn't simply have a way to write blogposts that support code like it does here. You have to find all those things.

I have some [gists](https://gist.github.com/jrcharney) and my [CodePen](https://codepen.io/jrcharney/) portfolio.

Also, stop letting these sales and marketing people make decisions. I saw a comment recently on a video about how great "vibe coding" is, and someone said "You know, the Death Star was vibe code it."  Learn how coidng works. Don't just accept the first thing that comes out of the A.I. prompt.  A.I. only gets it right 25% of the time, and the other 75% is you going back to undo an error that you asked the A.I. to do, but undid the wrong thing, snuck in some code you didn't ask for, your tries to gaslight you into making changes to your computer that aren't even necessary for your project to work. **So pay attention!**

A.I. has inspired me to get back into writing code again, but letting it do everything is a **TERRIBLE** idea.

Learn how to write code. Recognize coding errors. Don't let A.I. take the wheel.  It is **NOT** ready to do that.

## PROTECT THE NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION AND THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE!

NOAA and the NWS use a lot of high powered computer equipment to make calculations and forecast. To call it "part of an alarmist climate change industry" and demanding its privatization, dismantling, or any other "vibe coded" nonsense, PUTS PEOPLE'S LIVES AND PROPERTY IN DANGER AND WILL HAVE DEADLY CONSEQUENCES!

Visit the [American Meteorological Society](https://www.ametsoc.org/ams/about-ams/ams-statements/statements-of-the-ams-in-force/stand-up-for-noaa-research-the-time-to-act-is-now/) website and contact your representatives to reject The Heritage Foundation's attacks against NOAA and the NWS that were outlined in Project 2025.

And if your representatives won't do anything, or if they support putting us in danger, then **FIND THEM IN PERSON!** They have a history of running away or hiding at other things where they think they can find constituents and security guards that will protect them! **DON'T LET THEM GET AWAY!** (There is no "if" they will do this, they are already doing this, because they think they are immune to the destruction or they are paid not to care. And they are willing to silence free speech just to make it disappear. Today it could be "You can't talk about Palestine." Tommorrow, "You can't talk about the hurricane the President nuked."  (These people get all their ideas from television.  The ideal for "reopening Alcatraz" "idea" happened after *Escape from Alcatraz* [appeared on South Florida PBS](https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-announced-alcatraz-reopening-just-190423219.html) of all networks.  Imagine what could happen if you streamed *Pee-Wee's Playhouse*. [I think *Family Guy* perfectly summed it up.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDinNZhrWcQ).  If anything from *Family Guy* should ever happen, it should be [someone beating the crap out of him with a rolled up magazine!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDinNZhrWcQ).)

We can't wait for an electon in 2026 or 2028, and neither does severe weather. **THE DANGER IS HERE AND IT DOES NOT WAIT FOR ELECTIONS!**

## Contact
You can contact me here on Github. I have a [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasoncharney/) profile, but that website sucks. It's such a crappy place. All the ever do is try to con you into handing your personal information over to data brokers.  Also the rich people with their ego-stroking.  It ain't worth it, and I don't care if people think my opinions there are brash. Go see my stuff at those other links.
