> <h2>AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE TO PEOPLE WHO WRITE AND CODE!</h2>
>
> January 18, 2025
>
> As Generative Artificial Intelligence (G.A.I.) becomes more prevelent, there are people in the Corporate World ("corpos") who will tell you that "you don't need to write" or "you don't need to code anymore" or that "coding is irrelvant now that A.I. can do it."
>
> Even the people who operate this website have developed this attitude that you should replace your writing skills with their proprietary A.I. product.
>
> **DO NOT BELIEVE THEM!**
>
> Your coding skills are as relevant today as they were a few years ago. We need writes and coders!
>
> The legnedary author [Ray Bradbury](https://raybradbury.com/) warned us many years ago in fiction of [a world where reading was discouraged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit_451). Ficticiously, it was banned, but as we have seen in recent years, there are many people who still want to ban book and a growing group that wants to BURN them. 
>
> Any skill that requires critical thinking is important. The electronic calculator does not always replace the need to exercise mental arithmetic. The computer doesn't always replace the encyclopedia. The online shopping experience does not replace strolling through local shops, especially bookstores and sit-down restaurants. The smartphone and social media do not replace the need for social interaction.
>
> We still need people who can write. Whether it is books or computer code, we still need writers. We still need people to edit code and refactor code.  In fact, we still need EVERY creative skill, regardless if the corpos' shareholders think that it is not economically necessary.
>
> G.A.I. isn't all bad. It has helped out with a few tech issues when humans were not around to answer those questions, but use it sparingly. If anything, create your own Large Language Model (LLM) which is far more ethical than the G.A.I. these big tech companies have created that stole most of our data.  Remember to use metatags to restrict these things from taking your content. Remember to add a copyrwrite or license to your projects. And if necessary, take them to court for plagarism and copyright theft.
>
> But what ever you do: **DON'T STOP WRITING!** And don't let anyone tell you to stop! Write for yourself. And if you write for someone else, make sure you have a contract in writing. Join a union. Join a club. Just don't let these people steal yourself and act like "you put it out there for free." These are the same people who were ever told at a fan convention "Cosplay is not consent!"
>
> Fight for your right to be creative and fairly compensated for your creativity!

I am **Jason Charney** (@JRCharney).  I am a web developer in the St. Louis Area.

- 2022-2023: Washington University of St. Louis, Coding Bootcamp, St. Louis, MO

## Current Programming Interests
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **HTML5 Canvas from scratch.** Not all the time but with those drawing that should be simple.
- **SVG from scratch.** Again, not all the time, but with those simple drawing.
- **JavaScript (especially functional programming).** All your `.filter()`, `.map()`, and `.reduce()` are belong to us!
- **Node.js** to make use of that JavaScript on the server side.
- **JSON** is fun to tinker with if you import it from a separate file.
- **Git** to keep my skills here sharp
- **[Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) and [OpenStreetMaps](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)** - I recently worked on a Bootcamp project that reignited my interest in it.
- **[OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) and [National Weather Service API](https://weather-gov.github.io/api/)** - Another project that fulfilled a long time dream uses OWM, but I want to transition the app to use the NWS API.
- **[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/).** Simple functional programming. A lot easier to pick up than [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/). [This site](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) does help with learning Haskell, but have you downloaded a program that uses Haskell. It's Dependency Hell!
- **[Python](https://www.python.org/).** Trying to learn it. It's not hard. It's just trying to find time to do it. I bought a book on it right before I started the Wash U Bootcamp thinking I was going to spend my autumn (2022) finally learning how to use this.
- **Markdown with LaTeX and [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/)**. Did you know you can add Math and Diagrams?  Check this out!

\text{For } u = f(x), v = g(x) \\

\frac{d}{dx}(u \cdot v) &= \frac{du}{dx} \cdot v + u \cdot \frac{dv}{dx} && \text{Product Rule} \\
\frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{u}{v}\right) &= \frac{\frac{du}{dx} \cdot v - u \cdot \frac{dv}{dx}}{v^2} && \text{Quotient Rule}, v \ne 0

Pretty cool, right?

## Things you should know about my programming style

### I rarely use CSS Frameworks (e.g. Bootstrap). 
It's easier just to make something up from scratch.  Seriously.

If you look at my more recent projects I've done with the Washington University of St. Louis Coding Bootcamp, you will notice that I use the same stylesheets.

In most cases, I just compartamentalize my CSS code based on major componets, establish a color scheme, reuse previous animations.

Styling the Bootstrap way defeats having a stylesheet in the first place, is like writing code in HTML4 (which was deprecated over 20 years ago), and frankly you should have your own library of styles anyway to define yourself as a web developer.

### I eschew installing every plugin.

There was a quote from *The Dilbert Future* by Scott Adams (before he became what he is now): 

> "In the future, technology will make us less productive."

And he was right. Some plugins in VS Code just WRECK code and also break the automatic text insertion. Do I want to use plugins that make sure I didn't forget to use colon, comma, or semicolon somewhere? Yes. Do I want it to turn my short one-liners into multi-line code? No.  Do I want it to insert a block of Bootstrap code I'll never use. ABSOUTELY NOT!  And I especially don't like it when I format my code a certain way that I know is functionally perficient only for the indenting to be undone by some plugin written by some screwball who peaked in high school.

The whole point: Don't install every plugin. There's a lot of stuff the Prettier folks got wrong.

* [Emmet](https://emmet.io/) is good for writing code.
* [JsDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) is good for documenting your JavaScript.
* [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/) is good for Node Unit Testing.

### I prefer Linux.

Did you know I was turned down for a job once because I didn't own a Macbook?  I believe code should work on ANY operating system, but prefer to develop it on Linux.  You shouldn't have to take out a huge loan to buy a computer.  And you shouldn't be turned down for a job because you don't own an overpriced laptop.

Of course, the company seemed more like it was more interested in playing air hockey than it was writing code anyway. Their loss!

So, what does that have anything ot do with Linux?  Linux just works. It does everything.

### I won't relocate the West Coast or North East
The reason: COST.

The problem isn't that I'm too stubborn to move, it's just that what makes more sense: Paying $3 for gas in St. Louis or $8 for gas in San Jose? You don't need to be an economist to figure that out.

### The Tech Industry is fine. It's BIG TECH that's screwed.
The New York Times recently published that Computer Science Majors were going to have a hard time finding a job.  I've had my BSCS since 2007, and the only thing I've found out that impeded me from getting a job in the tech industry is the LACK of a tech industry because of an emphasis on relying on Big Tech.

But here's the problem with that.

**The smartest people in the room are NOT the ones with all the money.**

> Caution, short rant ensues.

There's the saying "If you're so smart, why aren't you rich?"  The saying should be "If you're so rich, why aren't you smart?"

Mark Zuckerberg admitted in November 2022 that he screwed up going all in on his Metaverse nonsense.  Anyone who grew up and remember the VR Bubble of the 1990s could have told you that.

Elon Musk is going into some serious legal trouble since he bought Twitter from Jack Dorsey in late 2022.  Social medial is a mess right now, espeically after Elon fired all the people who needed to be there to keep Twitter going.

Netflix is suffering because when you threaten people who use it with a VPN or who share passwords with family and don't offer a way to migrate or separate accounts, folks are going to flock to other streaming services.  It sucks we have so many streaming services! Especially since the media companies in charge of them (Disney, Discovery-Warner Bros., Paramount) don't want to pay creators, are destroying content for tax write offs (espeically anything where a lot of animation and visual effects were involved), increase prices, insert ads, and then wonder where all your customers are.

Amazon, I know everything is going to streaming, but there's something inhertedly wrong when you need to find a used book store or video store that is still around to get physical copies of stuff because the digital copies are being destroyed by order of the massive conglomorate that promised that they wouldn't remove it. (I'm looking at you David Zaslav of Discovery-Warner Bros!)  So start making a list of all the classic movies you like, and get a copy or make sure there's a copy at your local library in their video section.

**Para-social relationships with billionaires are unhealthy!**  Elon Musk is NOT your friend.  Jeff Bezos doesn't own you anything.  The Cloud where all the streaming content is located is actually someone else's computer and that somone else doesn't want to pay to host it anymore because they'd rather keep the money for themselves.

So stick it to these mostly-baldheaded men, pirate everything! Or at very least, buy a physical copy.  No more lost media!

Once that is done, invite some friends over to watch stuff.  It's time we started getting together and watching movies again.

Oh and **UNIONIZE THE TECH INDUSTRY!** We should have done that years ago.  Fight for time off. Fight for health care. Fight to stop these dumbass "innovators" who didn't make a damn thing despite how we are told how trendy they are.  Dennis Ritchie deserves more praise than Steve Jobs.  Women did most of the tech work before the men showed up and make the tech industry a frat house of toxic masculinity.  Black, Latin, Asian, Disabled, LGBTQIA+, Neurodivergent people should have a much bigger place at the table than these straight white guys who run everything and are now laying people off because they spent all their money on some meme cryptocurrency or some vaporware pet project that never had a viable business model!

**TECH WORKERS OF THE WORLD UNITE!**

## What I'm looking for in a boss/company

Does your company meet the following requirements:
* Located in the Midwest (preferably the St. Louis Area.)
* A boss who isn't an idiot
* A boss who isn't considered smart because he has money acquired by generational wealth
* A boss who can write code, has a Github, CodePen, HackerRank, Repl.it, JSFiddle, or other website (a minimum of 3 of those things or something like them) with code examples that aren't just some facimilie of examples plagarized from some O'Reilly Media books?
* A boss who doesn't try to piviot their employees' roles such as making web developers become on-call social media managers. (I am NOT going to update your Twitter, Instagram, or Facebook account! And I am NOT putting TikTok on my phone. You're a big boy. Update your own social media!)
* A boss who doesn't have a para-social relationship with Jesus. (You know, the kind that devotes *EVERYTHING* he does to Christ, including working out at the gym, setting the radio to either "Christian Music" or Sean Hannity, ruining school board and county government meetings with their roid rage, which ulitmately ruins being religous and leads that person down a rabbit hole of hate.)
* A boss who pays their employees at least once every 14 days, fills out the W-2 tax forms quarterly, uses a payroll system, and isn't squirreling the company's profits if in some offshore account in the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, Ireland, or some other tax shelter.
* A boss who will NEVER commit tax fraud, hire goons to commit said tax fraud, or have some washed-up celebrity attorney on the verge of disbarment have a press conference outside of the Four Seasons...Total Landscaping.
* A boss who didn't support political leaders who attempted a coup on this country. (There's a guy in Wentzville, Missouri who does tech stuff, but he was also part of that crowd on January 6, 2020, and he shouldn't even be allowed to run his own start-up let alone have employees call him their boss.)
* A boss who accepts that the Holocaust happened and was horroble, eschews any support of fascism, and rebukes anyone who suggests removing the U.S. Constitution because it doesn't fit with his record of authoritarism, oligarcy, fraud, or kleptocracy or the support of the tyrants who do it themselves.
* A boss who will never attempt to fire workers for suggesting talking about organized labor or forming a union.
* A boss who isn't offended by employees who speak their mind after years of watching other horrible bosses do a lot of the bad crap I just mentioned.

Then by all means, please hire me.  I'm sick of sending resumes to people who are OK with that crap.

I don't care if it mean I won't get a job. If you're OK with any of that crap, you shouldn't even in this industry lead alone running a company in this industry.

This industry needs new leadership.

## Contact
You can contact me here. I have a [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasoncharney/) profile, but that website sucks. It's such a crappy place. All the ever do is try to con you into handing your personal information over to data brokers.  Also the rich people with their ego-stroking.  It ain't worth it, and I don't care if people think my opinions there are brash. Go see my stuff at those other links.
