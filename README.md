# @JRCharney

Eventually, I will get [my website](https://www.jrcharney.com/) up and running again. WordPress kinda sucks and it doesn't simply have a way to write blogposts that support code like it does here. You have to find all those things.

## Contact
You can contact me here on Github. I have a [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasoncharney/) profile, but that website sucks. It's such a crappy place. All the ever do is try to con you into handing your personal information over to data brokers.  Also the rich people with their ego-stroking.  It ain't worth it, and I don't care if people think my opinions there are brash. Go see my stuff at those other links.
